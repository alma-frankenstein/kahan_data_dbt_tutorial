# Chapter 9 - dbt

"dbt" stands for "data build tool". It's used to write data transformations using SQL select statements. 

dbt is a fairly new technology. The downside of that is that, while [the dbt official docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) are pretty good, it can be harder to find information about it than something as established as, say, Python. The upside is that dbt is poised to become more popular, and being versed in it will give you an edge in the job market.

The goal for this week is to get familiar with dbt: what it does, how it works, and wehre to learn more. Feel free to spend time of dbt docs and tutorials outside of what's noted here.

We'll spend the first two days of this week working through the online fundamentals course provided by dbt. In episode 3 we'll explore datasets for more practice, and in episode 4 we'll make our own dbt project. Head to episode 1 to read more about the basics of dbt and get started.
